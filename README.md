I created Planet Kappa as a project to add some features to Freeciv that I'd like to try. The features would in theory be pretty extreme changes if I do them all, so I created a seperate project.

~~Freeciv is a Free and Open Source empire-building strategy game inspired by the history of human civilization.~~
